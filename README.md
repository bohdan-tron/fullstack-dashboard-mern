# React fullstack admin dashboard
MERN stack (MongoDB, mongoose, Express, React, RTK, Node).

## How to use the dashboard?
I did deploy the dashboard using render.com, its free plan 
shutting down the server after 15 minutes of inactivity 
but server is turning on approximetly in 180 seconds after the visitor appears,
so please just visit https://admin-dashboard-frontend-ltn8.onrender.com
and let the server load, thanks!

## What's worked:
Dashboard menus, data grid's, sidebar, responsivenes, dark/light theme options.

## What's in progress:
Transactions server side rendering.
